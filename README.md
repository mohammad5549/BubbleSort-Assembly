# BubbleSort-Assembly
BubbleSort program in C++, MIPS Assembly, and Optimized Compiler Generated Code

The MIPS assembly code implements a bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program uses structured procedures for modularity and incorporates macros for reusable functionalities like printing. The design separates the data (array and messages) from the execution logic, enhancing clarity.

The optimization process for the C++ sort function focused on reducing stack memory usage by substituting stack-based local variables with register-based variables. This results in fewer memory accesses, making the code more efficient.
